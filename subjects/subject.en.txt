In the Warlock, SpellBook and TargetGenerator classes, the switch statement is
FORBIDDEN and its use would result in a -42.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Create an abstract class called ASpell, in Coplien's form, that has the
following protected attributes:
=======
Create the following two spells, on the same model as Fwoosh:

* Fireball (Name: "Fireball", Effects: "burnt to a crisp")
* Polymorph (Name: "Polymorph", Effects: "turned into a critter")

In addition to this, just so he won't have only dummy to attack, let's make a
new target for him, which will be the BrickWall (Type: "Inconspicuous Red-brick Wall").

Now, make a SpellBook class, in canonical form, that can't be copied or instantiated
by copy. It will have the following functions:
>>>>>>> my_main

* void learnSpell(ASpell*), that COPIES a spell in the book
* void forgetSpell(string const &), that deletes a spell from the book, except
  if it isn't there
* ASpell* createSpell(string const &), that receives a string corresponding to
  the name of a spell, creates it, and returns it.

Modify the Warlock, now, make it have a spell book that will be created with
him and destroyed with him. Also make his learnSpell and forgetSpell functions
call those of the spell book.

The launchSpell function will have to use the SpellBook to create the spell
it's attempting to launch.

Make a TargetGenerator class, in canonical form, and as before,
non-copyable.

It will have the following functions:

* void learnTargetType(ATarget*), teaches a target to the generator

* void forgetTargetType(string const &), that makes the generator forget a
  target type if it's known

<<<<<<< HEAD

Now you will create an ATarget abstract class, in Coplien's form. It has a type
attribute, which is a string, and its associated getter, getType, that return a
reference to constant string.

In much the same way as ASpell, it has a clone() pure method.

All these functions can be called on a constant object.

It has a constructor that takes its type.

Now, add to your ATarget a getHitBySpell function that takes a reference to
constant ASpell.

It will display :

<TYPE> has been <EFFECTS>!

<TYPE> is the ATarget's type, and <EFFECTS> is the return of the ASpell's
getEffects function.

Finally, add to your ASpell class a launch function that takes a reference to
constant ATarget.

This one will simply call the getHitBySpell of the passed object, passing the
current instance as parameter.

When all this is done, create an implementation of ASpell called Fwoosh. Its
default constructor will set the name to "Fwoosh" and the effects to
"fwooshed". You will, of course, implement the clone() method. In the case of
Fwoosh, it will return a pointer to a new Fwoosh object.

In the same way, create a concrete ATarget called Dummy, the type of which
is "Target Practice Dummy". You must also implement its clone() method.

Add to the Warlock the following member functions:

* learnSpell, takes a pointer to ASpell, that makes the Warlock learn a spell
* forgetSpell, takes a string corresponding a to a spell's name, and makes the
  Warlock forget it. If it's not a known spell, does nothing.
* launchSpell, takes a string (a spell name) and a reference to ATarget, that
  launches the spell on the selected target. If it's not a known spell, does
  nothing.

You will need a new attribute to store the spells your Warlock knows. Several
types fit the bill, it's up to you to choose the best one.

Below is a possible test main and its expected output:
=======
* ATarget* createTarget(string const &), that creates a target of the
  specified type

Phew, that's done. Now here's a test main. It's not very thorough, so make sure 
to use your own aswell.
>>>>>>> my_main

int main()
{
  Warlock richard("Richard", "foo");
  richard.setTitle("Hello, I'm Richard the Warlock!");
  BrickWall model1;

  Polymorph* polymorph = new Polymorph();
  TargetGenerator tarGen;

  tarGen.learnTargetType(&model1);
  richard.learnSpell(polymorph);

  Fireball* fireball = new Fireball();

  richard.learnSpell(fireball);

  ATarget* wall = tarGen.createTarget("Inconspicuous Red-brick Wall");

  richard.introduce();
  richard.launchSpell("Polymorph", *wall);
  richard.launchSpell("Fireball", *wall);
}

~$ ./a.out | cat -e
Richard: This looks like another boring day.$
Richard: I am Richard, Hello, I'm Richard the Warlock!!$
